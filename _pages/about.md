<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a Ph.D. candidate of network science in the <a href="https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/" target="_blank"> Department of Network and Data Science </a> at the Central European University. In my dissertation I study urban mobility in multiplex urban networks. Currently I am working on multiplex urban fingerprints for bicycle network planning. I have been a visiting researcher at the Center for Civic Media (MIT Media Lab).  </div>
