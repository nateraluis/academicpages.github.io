# Welcome!

New year, new website. During the final weeks of last year I decided to renew my personal website, and here it is, welcome! The site will serve as a repository for my projects and a way to share works in progress. During the following months, I'll be uploading new and old projects. In the mean time here are two data visualization projects [[1]](https://luisnatera.com/posts/2017/12/Budapest-Street-Network/) [[2]](https://luisnatera.com/posts/2018/07/Community-Detection/) and a [talk](https://luisnatera.com/talks/2018-SICC) I gave at the ComplexCity@polito workshop.
